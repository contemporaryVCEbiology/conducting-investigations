        <p>Take a look at the ‘poster’ tab of the ‘explain’ section of this app if you need a more detailed description of any of the poster requirements. The information you’ll need for this section should be in your logbook already! </p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <p>You can now start writing your introduction! Use the background research, aim and hypothesis you’ve already formulated in your logbook to complete this section. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <p>When putting together the materials and methods sections be careful to copy accurately from your logbook. Make sure all measurements and steps are correct. If you made changes along the way, make sure they are in the write up!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <p>You can now collate your results! Decide how you are going to present your data and make sure it is clear, easy to read and makes sense. Remember to include a description of your results- keeping in mind that this is different to the discussion.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <p>Start your discussion and conclusion section by stating whether your hypothesis was supported. If your teacher has provided you with discussion questions, answer them here. If not, use your background research to explain your results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <p>You can now put together your abstract. Take the most important information from the rest of the sections to create the abstract. Remember to keep it as brief as possible!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <p>Remember: You must include a bibliography as per your teachers requirements!</p>
