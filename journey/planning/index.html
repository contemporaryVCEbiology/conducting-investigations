        <p>Time to grab your logbook! Take a look at the ‘getting started’ tab of the logbook section to help you keep an accurate logbook.</p> 
        <p>Remember to keep it on you at all times and fill it in when you see the logbook symbol.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <p>You can now choose an area of study that you wish to design your experiment around! Start by thinking about a topic you found interesting or enjoyable and if you can’t remember what you’ve covered&mdash;take a look at the study design.</p>
        <p>Remember to choose something you wont get bored of easily!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <p>It’s time to design your research question. This can be confusing but remember: scientific questions usually start with How, What, When, Who, Which, Why or Where. Your question should also contain one variable you can change and one variable you can measure.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <p>Begin conducting background research now. Include information such as: What do we know about this topic? What past research has been done? Why is it important or relevant?</p>
        <p>Remember: research isn’t limited to this part of your investigation&mdash;you should be researching throughout!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <p>At this point, you should be designing your aim and hypothesis. That is: what you are testing and what you expect to be the results!</p>

    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <p>Once you’ve designed your aim, you need to work out how you’ll conduct the experiment and what materials and equipment you will use. Remember to be as precise and accurate as possible!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <p>Before getting stuck into the experiment, remember to consider: can the results be observed or measured? Is the experiment related to your question? Is it fair, safe and ethically sound?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <p>You need to ask yourself if your experiment is realistic- do you have the time and equipment/money to carry it out? If ‘yes’: go ahead! If ‘no’: you should reconsider your design! Ask your teacher what equipment and materials will be available to you. </p>
